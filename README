                SiRFIDaL - Simple RFID authentication for Linux
                -----------------------------------------------

This is a set of utilities to use RFID or NFC transponder UIDs as authentication
tokens on a Linux computer - typically for login purposes.

Admittedly, UIDs are a weak form of authentication. They're really no better
than passwords. But for non-critical applications - personal computer users,
non-critical work environments - they're good enough and very convenient.
If you're in that situation, read on. If you need strong security, don't use
these utilities!

The utilities included are:

- sirfidal_server: core program used by all the others. It manages RFID or NFC
                   readers and authenticates users against RFID / NFC UIDs on
                   behalf of other programs.

- sirfidal_pam: PAM module that uses the SiRFIDaL server to authenticate users
                against RFID or NFC UIDs, typcally to login.

- sirfidal_useradm: utility to add or delete users allowed to authenticate
                    with RFID / NFC UIDs.

- sirfidal_autolockscreen: program to lock/unlock a graphical interface
                           screensaver automatically using authenticated RFID
                           or NFC transponders.

- sirfidal_beep: program to beep when a RFID or NFC transponder is read by a
                 reader, or taken off the reader.



Installation instructions for the busy man
------------------------------------------

These are instructions to install the utilities on Linux Mint, which is based
on Ubuntu, and running systemd and the Cinnamon environment.

If your Linux system isn't Linux Mint, please modify the *.py Python scripts,
*.service systemd service files and sirfidal_pam.config PAM configuration files
accordingly. See the comments in the Python scrips for details and available
configurable parameters.

As root:

  * Prerequisits:

    * Python3 installation:

       apt-get install python3

    * Use with PC/SC readers:

       apt-get install pcscd pcsc-tools
       - Configure PC/SC for your readers. If pcsc-scan works, SiRFIDaL will
         work also. See https://pcsclite.apdu.fr/
       - Make sure watch_pcsc is set to True in sirfidal_server.py

    * Use with a serial reader:

       - Set serial_reader_dev_file to the device file corresponding to your
         reader in sirfidal_server.py. Make sure you have read righs.
       - Make sure watch_serial is set to True in sirfidal_server.py

    * Python3 modules needed (apt-get installation preferred, pip3 otherwise):

      apt-get install python3-pyscard
      apt-get install python3-filelock
      apt-get install python3-psutil
      pip3 install playsound

  * Install the files:

    cp *.py /usr/local/bin
    cp *.service files /lib/systemd/system
    cp sirfidal_pam.config /usr/share/pam-configs
    mkdir -p /usr/local/share/sounds/sirfidal
    cp sounds/* /usr/local/share/sounds/sirfidal

  * Enable and start the systemd services:

    systemctl enable sirfidal_server
    systemctl start sirfidal_server

    systemctl enable sirfidal_beep
    systemctl start sirfidal_beep

  * Configure PAM for single factor authentication (password or RFID / NFC):

    - Edit /usr/share/pam-configs/unix and add "nodelay" after "pam_unix.so"
      in the Auth sections

  * Configure PAM for two-factor authentication (password and RFID / NFC):

    - Edit /usr/share/pam-configs/unix and replace "success=end" with
      "success=ok" in the Auth sections

  * Finalize PAM configuration

    pam-auth-update

As a user:

  * Run the screensaver automatic locker / unlocker:

    - In Preferences > Startup Applications, click on + > Custom command
    - Enter the name "RFID / NFC lock / unlock screen" (or whatever you want)
    - Enter the command "/usr/local/bin/sirfidal_autolockscreen.py"
    - Click Add
    - Select the entry and click on the gears icon to run it now
